### About:
A simple Webpack setup for writing [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) apps:

* Dev server with live reloading, HMR
* Support for CSS/SCSS (with Autoprefixer), image assets
* Bootstrap 3.3+ (Sass version)
* Bundling and minification for deployment
* Basic app scaffold, using `Html.beginnerProgram`
* A snippet of example code to get you started!

Clone this repo into a new project folder, e.g. `my-elm-project`:
```

Re-initialize the project folder as your own repo:
```
rm -rf .git         # on Windows: rmdir .git /s /q
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
